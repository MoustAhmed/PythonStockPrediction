The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{Y_i - \hat{Y}_i}{Y_i} \right| \times 100 \]

Where:
- \( n \) is the number of observations.
- \( Y_i \) is the actual value for observation \( i \).
- \( \hat{Y}_i \) is the predicted value for observation \( i \).

This formula provides a measure of the average percentage difference between actual and predicted values.
